## Gitpod Reminders

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.
To migrate changes to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate` (`python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run`)
To run the project `python3 manage.py runserver`

<h1>Welcome to Good Food!</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
This project is the fourth in my full stack developer course at Code Institute that I will be completing in october 2022. 

I installed Django and the supporting libraries. Since I will deploy the project to Heroku I also installed gunicorn as the server that I will use to run Django on Heroku. 

The supporting libraries are postreql and psycopg2. 

The images will be on Cloudinary. 

I called the project "goodfood" in Dajngo and the manage.py app is called "food". 



<h2>Deployment</h2>
Cloudinary
Heroku
